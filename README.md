- 👋 Hi, I’m @requazar! I am 16 and learning my way in the world!
- 👀 I’m interested in Friday Night Funkin' Modding, be it music or programming!(I exclusively mod for the V-Slice engine.)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to make music! I've got a wonderful teacher and awesome friends to help me learn.
- 💞️ I’m currently not taking commissions for music, but that may change in the future. Message reqvazar on discord to check if commissions are open. 
- 📫 You can message reqvazar on discord. Any other form of communication I do not use or will not share.
